# Digital Privacy & Security

What we'll cover:

* The Mindset
* The Tools
* Further Reading
* Questions

---

## The Mindset

To start, some background on  
my reasoning, preferences,  
biases, and general worldview.

---

## The Mindset

Why?

* Prevent getting hacked
* Prevent getting profiled
* Prevent Setting arrested
* F--k big companies
  * And specifically surveillance capitalism
* It's cool & fun

---

## The Mindset

Requirements/Preferences

* Open-source
* Cross-platform

---

## The Mindset

* Privacy/security vs. convenience
* Other people (the worst)

---

## The Tools

Next, we'll cover some tools  
you  can download today to  
enhance your  digital privacy  
and security.

These are roughly in  
descending  order if  
importance. Most are free,  
and I'll call out where they  
aren't.
