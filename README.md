# Digital Privacy & Security

What we'll cover:

* The Mindset
* The Tools
* Further Reading
* Questions

---

## The Mindset

To start, some background on  
my reasoning, preferences,  
biases, and general worldview.

---

## The Mindset

Why care about digital privacy and security?

* Prevent getting hacked
* Prevent getting profiled
* Prevent getting arrested
* F--k big companies
  * And specifically surveillance capitalism
* It's cool & fun

---

## The Mindset

Requirements/Preferences

* Open-source
* Cross-platform

---

## The Mindset

* Privacy/security vs. convenience
* Other people (the worst)

---

## The Tools

Next, we'll cover some tools  
you can download today to  
enhance your digital privacy  
and security.

These are roughly in  
descending  order if  
importance. Most are free,  
and I'll call out where they  
aren't.

## The Tools: Password Manager

* Why?
  * Using unique, hard-to-guess passwords for all of your accounts is the #1 thing you can do to increase your internet security.
  * A password manager is the best way to achieve this.
* David recommends: [Bitwarden][1]
* Why not 1Password?

## The Tools: TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)

* What?
* Why?
  * 2FA (something you know + something you have)
  * SMS-based 2FA is hackable  
    _(but still better than nothing)_
* David recommends:
  * iOS: [Raivo OTP][2] ([App Store][3])
  * Android: [Aegis][4] ([F-Droid][5])
* Why I don't use Bitwarden TOTP

---

## The Tools: Email

* Why?
  * Your email is the skeleton key to all of your other accounts _(i.e. it is important)_
  * Google can cancel your account at any time
  * They also read all your emails
* David recommends: [Fastmail][6] ($5/mo., $50/yr.)
  * Plus the cost of a custom domain if desired

---

## The Tools: Ad/Tracker Blocking

* Why?
  * Prevent being profiled
  * The internet is a ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ without one
* David recommends:
  * Desktop: [Firefox][7] with [uBlock Origin][8]
  * iOS: [Roadblock][9]
  * Android: [DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser][16]

---

## The Tools: More Firefox Fun

* Multi-Account Containers
* LocalCDN
* ClearURLs

---

## The Tools: Search

* What?
* Why?
  * Plus Google results suck now
* David recommends: [DuckDuckGo][11]

---

## The Tools: VPN (Virtual Private Network)

* What?
  * _what is a VPN?_
* Why?
  * Prevent network-level snooping
  * Mask your identity
  * Reduce fingerprinting surface
* David recommends: [Mullvad][12] (â‚¬5/mo.)

---

## The Tools: Messaging

* What?
* Why?
* David recommends: [Signal][13]
  * Apple Messages is fine too 
    (if all of your contacts are on iOS)
  * WhatsApp is also OK  
    (but has that Zuck stink on it)
  * Really anything but SMS pls

[13]: https://www.signal.org/

---

## The Tools: Open-Source Operating Systems

* What?
* Why?
* David recommends:
  * [Manjaro][17] (or most Linuxes really)
  * [CalyxOS][14]

[14]: https://calyxos.org/
[17]: https://manjaro.org/

---

## The Tools: Other Things I Haven't Tried

* [YubiKey][18]
* [Secretive][19]
