## Digital Privacy & Security

How to keep yourself safe(r)  
and anonymous(er) as you  
travel the internet.

---

## Digital Privacy & Security

What we'll cover:

* The Mindset
* The Tools
* Closing Thoughts
* Questions

---

## The Mindset

To start, some background on  
my reasoning, preferences,  
biases, and general worldview.

---

## The Mindset

Why care about digital privacy and security?

* Prevent getting hacked
* Prevent getting profiled
* Prevent getting arrested
* F--k big companies
  * And specifically surveillance capitalism
* It's cool & fun

---

## The Mindset

Requirements/Preferences

* Open-source
* Cross-platform
* Prefer to pay with my money than my personal information

---

## The Tools

Next, we'll cover some tools  
you can download today to  
enhance your digital privacy  
and security.

These are roughly in  
descending  order if  
importance. Most are free,  
and I'll call out where they  
aren't.

## The Tools: Password Manager

* What?
  * An application that generates and stores passwords
* Why?
  * Using unique, hard-to-guess passwords for all of your accounts is the #1 thing you can do to increase your internet security.
  * A password manager is the best way to achieve this.
* David recommends: [Bitwarden][1]
* Why not 1Password?

## The Tools: TOTP (Time-based One Time Password)

* What?
  * An app that programmatically generates expiring six-digit codes you use to log in
  * (in addition to a password)
  * (typically only the first time on a new device)
* Why?
  * Two-factor auth (something you know + something you have)
  * SMS-based 2FA is hackable  
    _(but still better than nothing)_
* David recommends:
  * iOS: [Raivo OTP][2] ([App Store][3])
  * Android: [Aegis][4] ([F-Droid][5])
* Why I don't use Bitwarden TOTP

## The Tools: Email

* What?
  * Your email account
* Why?
  * Your email is the skeleton key to all of your other accounts _(i.e. it is important)_
  * Google can cancel your account at any time
  * They also read all your emails
* David recommends: [Fastmail][6] ($5/mo., $50/yr.)
  * Plus the cost of a custom domain if desired

[6]: https://www.fastmail.com/

---

## The Tools: Ad/Tracker Blocking

* What?
  * A browser extension that blocks ads and tracking scripts
* Why?
  * Prevent being profiled
  * The internet is a ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ without one
* David recommends:
  * Desktop: [Firefox][7] with [uBlock Origin][8]
  * iOS: [Roadblock][9]
  * Android: [DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser][16]

## The Tools: More Firefox Fun

* [Multi-Account Containers][22]
* [LocalCDN][23]
* [ClearURLs][24]

[24]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/

---

## The Tools: Search

* What?
  * A website you use to find other websites
* Why?
  * You send a search engine a lot of data about yourself
  * So better to pick one that doesn't store that info and use it to serve you ads
  * Plus Google results suck now
* David recommends: [DuckDuckGo][11]

---

## The Tools: VPN (Virtual Private Network)

* What?
  * Think of it like a tube
  * To the local network, all of your web traffic just looks like it's going to the VPN server
  * To external hosts, your IP is the VPN's
* Why?
  * Prevent network-level snooping
  * Mask your identity
  * Reduce fingerprinting surface
* David recommends: [Mullvad][12] (â‚¬5/mo.)
  * (+ a credit card w/o foreign transaction fees)

[12]: https://mullvad.net/en/

---

## The Tools: Messaging

* What?
  * End-to-end (e2e) encrypted messaging app
* Why?
  * IDK, I'm a private person
  * e2e-encrypted apps make your communication less likely to be intercepted by third parties
* David recommends: [Signal][13]
  * Apple Messages is fine too  
    (if all of your contacts are on iOS)
  * WhatsApp is also OK  
    (but has that Zuck stink on it)
  * Really anything but SMS pls

[13]: https://www.signal.org/

---

## The Tools: Open-Source Operating Systems

* What?
  * An operating system not made by Apple, Google, or Microsoft
* Why?
  * Auditable
  * Not typically in the spyware/adware business
  * Some are made for privacy specifically
  * Generally made by like-minded folks
* David recommends:
  * [Manjaro][17] (or most Linuxes really)
  * [CalyxOS][14]

[14]: https://calyxos.org/
[17]: https://manjaro.org/

---

## The Tools: Other Things I Haven't Tried

* [YubiKey][18]
* [Secretive][19]
